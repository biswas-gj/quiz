#### **Written Questions**
1. **Explain the difference between InputStream and OutputStream in socket programming. Provide an example of how they are used.**  
   **Answer:**  
   `InputStream` reads data from a socket, while `OutputStream` writes data to a socket. Example:
   ```java
   Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
   OutputStream out = socket.getOutputStream();
   out.write("Hello Server".getBytes());

   InputStream in = socket.getInputStream();
   byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
   int bytesRead = in.read(buffer);
   System.out.println("Received: " + new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));
   ```

2. **What are the key differences between TCP and UDP in Java socket programming?**  
   **Answer:**  
   - TCP is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable data transfer.  
   - UDP is connectionless, allowing faster but unreliable communication.  
   - TCP is used for applications like HTTP and FTP, while UDP is used for real-time streaming.  

3. **Describe how an HTTP request works. Explain the role of request headers.**  
   **Answer:**  
   An HTTP request consists of a request line (method, URL, protocol), headers, and an optional body.  
   Example request:  
   ```
   GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
   ```
   - `Host`: Specifies the server.  
   - `User-Agent`: Identifies the client software.  

4. **How does a Java server handle multiple clients using threads? Provide a brief example.**  
   **Answer:**  
   A server uses multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.  
   ```java
   ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(8080);
   while (true) {
       Socket client = server.accept();
       new Thread(() -> handleClient(client)).start();
   }
   ```

5. **What are the common HTTP status codes and their meanings? Provide examples of scenarios where each might be used.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - `200 OK`: Successful request (e.g., retrieving a webpage).  
   - `404 Not Found`: Resource does not exist (e.g., missing page).  
   - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side failure (e.g., unhandled exception).  
   - `301 Moved Permanently`: Redirect (e.g., changed domain).

   - B) `tcp.port==80`  
   - C) `protocol==HTTP`  
   - D) `dst port 443`  

   **Explanation:**  
   - The **correct filter is** `port 80`, but `tcp.port == 80` also works.  
   - **Example of other useful filters:**  
     - `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1` → **Capture only traffic from 192.168.1.1**

     - Converts **private IP** → **public IP**.  
   - **PAT (Port Address Translation) = NAT Overloading:**  
     - **Multiple private IPs share one public IP** using **different ports.**  
     - **Example:**  
       - `192.168.1.2:5000 → 203.0.113.1:15000`  
       - `192.168.1.3:5001 → 203.0.113.1:15001` ✅

# **📌 5 Written/Short Answer Questions with Math**  

### **1️⃣ Subnetting Calculation**
**Q1: Given an IP address 192.168.10.0/26, calculate:**  
   - The **Subnet Mask**  
   - The **Number of Subnets**  
   - The **Number of Usable Hosts per Subnet**  

📌 **Solution:**  
   - **Subnet Mask:** `/26 = 255.255.255.192`  
   - **Number of Subnets:**  
     - **Formula:** `2^(borrowed bits)`  
     - Borrowed 2 bits → `2^2 = 4 subnets`  
   - **Usable Hosts per Subnet:**  
     - **Formula:** `(2^host bits) - 2`  
     - `2^6 - 2 = 62 usable hosts per subnet`  

---

### **2️⃣ Wildcard Mask Calculation**
**Q2: What is the wildcard mask for 255.255.255.240?**  

📌 **Solution:**  
   - **Formula:** `255.255.255.255 - Subnet Mask`  
   - `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.240 = 0.0.0.15` ✅  

---

### **3️⃣ NAT Table Translation**
**Q3: Given this NAT Table, find the missing translation.**  

| Private IP | Private Port | Public IP | Public Port |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 192.168.1.2 | 5000 | 203.0.113.1 | 15000 |
| 192.168.1.3 | 5001 | 203.0.113.1 | 15001 |
| 192.168.1.4 | 5002 | **?** | **?** |

📌 **Solution:**  
   - **Public IP = Same as other translations** → `203.0.113.1`  
   - **Public Port = Next Available Port** → `15002`  
   - **Answer:** `203.0.113.1:15002` ✅  

---

### **4️⃣ ACL Rules**
**Q4: Write an ACL rule to block all traffic from 192.168.1.100 but allow everything else.**  

📌 **Solution:**  
   - **Standard ACL:** (Blocks only source IP)  
   ```plaintext
   access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.100
   access-list 1 permit any
   ```
   - **Extended ACL:** (Can block based on source/destination)  
   ```plaintext
   access-list 100 deny ip 192.168.1.100 any
   access-list 100 permit ip any any
   ```

---

### **5️⃣ CIDR Notation Conversion**
**Q5: Convert the subnet mask 255.255.255.248 to CIDR notation and find the number of hosts.**  

📌 **Solution:**  
   - **Subnet Mask to CIDR:**  
     - `255.255.255.248` → **/29** ✅  
   - **Hosts per Subnet:**  
     - **Formula:** `(2^host bits) - 2`  
     - `/29` means 3 host bits → `2^3 - 2 = 6 hosts` ✅

   - A) ARP packets only  
   - B) TCP packets only  
   - C) No filter (captures everything)  ✅  
   - D) UDP packets only  
   
   *Explanation:* By default, Wireshark captures all network traffic unless a specific filter is applied.

2. **Which display filter would you use in Wireshark to capture only HTTP traffic?**
   - A) `tcp.port == 80` ✅  
   - B) `udp.port == 80`  
   - C) `ip.dst == 192.168.1.1`  
   - D) `icmp`

3. **Which protocol uses the Administrative Distance (AD) of 120?**
   - A) OSPF  
   - B) EIGRP  
   - C) RIP ✅  
   - D) BGP

   - C) 255.255.255.0  
   - D) 255.255.0.0  
   
   *Explanation:* Wildcard masks are used in ACLs and routing. A /24 subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, so its wildcard mask is 0.0.0.255.

8. **What is the main difference between NAT and PAT?**
   - A) NAT maps private to public IPs, PAT maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP ✅  
   - B) PAT works only with IPv6  
   - C) NAT is only used in data centers

...

## **Written Questions**

### 1. **Calculate the wildcard mask for a /22 subnet.**
   *Answer:* A /22 subnet has a subnet mask of `255.255.252.0`. The wildcard mask is found by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:  
   - `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.252.0 = 0.0.3.255`

### 2. **Write a TCPdump command to capture only ICMP packets.**
   *Answer:* The command is:
   ```bash
   tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
   ```

### 3. **Explain how OSPF calculates link cost.**
   *Answer:* OSPF cost is calculated using the formula:
   ```
   Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth
   ```
   The default reference bandwidth is 100 Mbps. For a 10 Mbps link:
   ```
   Cost = 100 Mbps / 10 Mbps = 10
   ```
